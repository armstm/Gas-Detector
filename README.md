In this project we are going to learn how to design a Gas Leakage Detector 
with SMS Alert using GSM Module & Arduino. We will interface Sim800 GSM Module 
as well as MQ135 Gas Sensor with Arduino. The gas level value will be displayed 
on 16Ã—2 LCD Display. Whenever the excess gas is detected SMS will be sent to a 
particular phone number.
